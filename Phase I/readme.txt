Attached are various resources we will use in studying the behaviour of Van der Pol Oscillators. 
The Supplementary material to Martens et al paper contains the core differential equations to simulate. 
A basic understanding of linear oscillators and a Van der Pol oscillators wouldn't hurt you. 

The MATLAB code is horribly organized. Maybe that's for the best, I would cry if I had to decode and copy from it. But it works, so in the end we will have a backup to fall on if you're stuck somewhere.
