Some basic theory for the Kuramoto system. I have also attached the Strogatz book on Nonlinear dynamics, which is basically the bible for NLD. A visual simulation of Kuramoto system (creds: Cleve Moler) is already attached here. It's not as versatile as we would need for our research.

Also attached are the literature review in synchronization: Basins of attraction for phase-locked state, Analytical algebraic solution for  Kuramoto Oscillators, and Phase transitions in synchronous states (especially chimera states)
