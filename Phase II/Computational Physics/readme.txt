Find here resources for various numerical methods used in Computational Physics. The book is decent and enough for the most basic understanding in it. Another useful resource would be consulting: <a href="https://cosmolearning.org/courses/learn-differential-equations-tutorials-with-gilbert-strang-cleve-moler/">the Cleve Moler and Gilbert Strang series</a> two of the most influential people in this field.

Also, I have attached the research on modelling the metronomes more accurately. That will be the core differential equation to handle.
